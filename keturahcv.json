I made a lot of mistakes as I shifted the class from relying on a physical textbook to being fully accessible online. Students had no need for a textbook for the RHT101 course, but students were required to use a Low Cost (&lt;$20) text for RHT102. All my courses are web-based, have an interactive syllabus design or materials and utilize a Low Cost/No Cost text.</p>\n<p>Online: I&rsquo;m teaching online for Triton College for the first time. The minimal contact makes everything more challenging. I have noted several areas in my course design that need improvement and have begun planning toward that end.</p>\n<p>Blackboard Learn feature: There is a neat feature in Blackboard that permits teachers to open and close assignment access. I use this feature for In-Class Writing Assignments. Students have a list of all in-class writings ahead of time (on the syllabus) so they know what to expect. The timed writings are hard at the start of the semester. Over time however, the practice of quickly organizing one&rsquo;s thoughts and writing them in a 1 page essay begins to take shape. At the end of the semester students praise the process. I learned this technique while working with international students. It was based loosely on the same ideas as &ldquo;rocket math&rdquo;; though not quite gamification, the student is in similar fashion, competing against their own self. After drawing on my experience with In-Class Writing and then taking a semester abroad to do some field study with EFL students in a different country, I learned that the timed aspects enhanced the method&rsquo;s efficacy.</p>\n<p>Though not required, I have added a \"Recordings from Class\" menu item in Blackboard for student use. I surveyed the students and learned that this added item was helpful. I will continue to implement this menu item.</p>\n<p>Digital illiteracy can be a major hindrance for students who are required to make use of online resources but may not know how to do so. Portable tech gives students access to a number of web hosted tools, but what is the use of access if a student does not know how to engage the material or where to find it? I teach students where to find materials and I create <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nK5RDxmnr9oTyB8h9ngJGxlwJQQludyiUr1gyPUBAIA/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">resources</a>, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CTbJSnzPA5XVMOLa-ZP7Lz2UxYTc9I-w/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Guidelines for the Essays</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fz7rRyh90TOT7daPpmZELLzMPdjH11bew66cc3wWMss/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FAQs</a>, video tutorials of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/EoomkbbrmNs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&ldquo;How this course works&rdquo;</a> for every class I teach, etc.</p>\n<p>Graffiti is a class activity that engages participation by giving students an opportunity to use the online white board. The whiteboard often feels &ldquo;off limits&rdquo; but giving opportunity to use the Collaborate tools is an invitation of ownership. As a group we listen to an NPR podcast assignment and then write our responses to it together on the board during the session. It helps us all engage with the materials and it's fun. <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/ubaT6CyeobEvt61r8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">View a Graffiti session result.</a></p>\n<p>This year, like many teachers, I&rsquo;ve had to rely on Blackboard Collaborate. The transition has not been seamless for me nor for my students. Students have taught me to appreciate their voice and to respect their ability to be attentive without constant policing. I surveyed the summer groups of 102 students and redesigned the class based on the information students shared with me. Here are some results: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1K5-U6BTgDm8GrTvhrGvgw04DhnfdyCOKM7M30EeEJ3k/viewanalytics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Group 1</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LWl7CxRzrGwH1TG4cgELw3Elf_sKLKvgsQiVwKSkGR4/viewanalytics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Group 2</a>.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h3>Short Stories Index</h3>\n<p>The Short Stories Index is a collaborative index tool for Web Sourced literature and/or criticism pieces for the classroom and faculty community. This is an ongoing collaborative project between myself and my students (several faculty members have also contributed). Students have been building this index with me over the last 4 years and it has been a very cool project. This last semester we added film. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UWjaBDedBq0_NTGnqEuUhrUI-aGphxDZfzC_5BwBt1I/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">View the Short Stories Index</a>.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h3>Technology in the Classroom</h3>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h3><cite>They Say, I Say</cite></h3>\n<p>This text will be updated to the 5th edition in 2021. I remain consistently impressed with the value, ease of use (design), accessibility (content) of this book. Professor Richard Chan asked me for recommendations on how to support student writing labs, and we settled on a chapter from this book called \"Writing in the Sciences.\" It is useful across disciplines.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h3>LIVE Listening</h3>\n<p>I noted a large group of ERL students wished to keep their cameras off. When I asked why, I learned a lot about the vulnerabilities that students face or feel they face when in the classroom space. When we first started ERL teaching in March, I insisted that cameras remain on, but I relented after hearing different perspectives. I was surprised that I had learned to listen better when the cameras were off. I noticed similar things about students engaging with each other and with the material. It was as if the cameras were adding an extra burden of intimidation to their experience in an already high-pressure situation. When I can accommodate students immediately, I do <em>not</em> wait until the following semester to implement a new method. I apply it right away. I call this LIVE listening.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h3>Learning Management Systems</h3>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h3>Blended Learning</h3>\n</section>"
