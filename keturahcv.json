This year, 2020, I also expanded the garden by adding a second location because of food deficits in the local community. Joblessness and food insecurity have become a challenge for many residents in our district due to the current pandemic. Our church community continues to maintain a connection with the local food banks, supply items in support of addressing food deficits.</p>\n        <p>From the Summer 2020 Garden in Maywood, we harvested and gave to the community 24 butternut squash, 30+ ears of corn, bunches of green beans, onions, and 20+ lbs of tomatoes. More shared food from the Fall 2020 garden includes radish, beets, chard, kale, spinach, collard greens, onion, basil, broccoli, carrots, buttercrunch lettuce. All of this is for sharing with the community. The Fall 2020 Garden is part of the Greens and Microgreens Initiative that I started in a second location in Forest Park in an accessible location on Harlem Ave. This location is adjacent to a parking lot of one of the Housing Forward shelter locations and is open to the community. It is a garden that hosts fall vegetables amenable to growing in cool weather environments (beyond frost or below 20 degrees F).</p>\n        <p>None of the gardens utilize hydro-/aquaponics. None of the gardens use pesticides. All are grown from seed. All are outdoors.</p>\n      ",
